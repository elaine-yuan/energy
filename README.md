Journey to the Best: Global and Chinese Growth of Green Energy

In a weeklong independent project, I examined UN Energy Statistics because I am interested in the implementation of renewable energy sources for a greener, cleaner planet. What countries are producing the most renewable energy? What is contributing to their success in the green energy sector? How can we, the United States, improve? I discovered the popularity of hydro energy and the green energy powerhouse that is China. One reason for China's growth is effective infrastructure, i.e. dams and power plants. 

After data cleaning in Excel and data analysis in Tableau, I presented my findings in a PowerPoint presentation:
1. The U.S. and other countries can learn from China's prioritization of green energy. 
2. Hydro energy is the most popular and efficient renewable energy source in the world. 
3. Other energy sources, including nonrenewable nuclear energy, can be developed.
