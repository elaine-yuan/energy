Journey to the Best: Global and Chinese Growth of Green Energy

In a weeklong independent project, I examined UN Energy Statistics because I am interested in the implementation of renewable energy sources for a greener, cleaner planet. What countries are producing the most renewable energy? What is contributing to their success in the green energy sector? How can we, the United States, improve? I discovered the popularity of hydro energy and the green energy powerhouse that is China. One reason for China's growth is effective infrastructure, i.e. dams and power plants. 

After data cleaning in Excel and data analysis in Tableau, I studied 9,745 total records of renewable energy data and 34,936 records of global power plant data and presented my findings in a PowerPoint presentation:
1. The U.S. and other countries can learn from China's prioritization of green energy: in 2019, China produced 30% of global hydro energy, 28% of global wind energy, and 33% of global solar energy.
2. Hydro energy is the most popular and efficient renewable energy source in the world: from 1990 to 2019, there is a 445% increase in global hydroelectricity generation.
3. Nonrenewable nuclear energy can be developed because although nuclear power plants are <1% of total power plants, they accounted for 7.15% of global power plant capacity.
